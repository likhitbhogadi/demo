# Slideshow Generator Web Application Technical Report

## Project Overview

This project is a web-based slideshow generator that allows users to upload images, apply transition effects, add background music, and create downloadable video slideshows. The application has user authentication, image storage, video processing capabilities, and an admin interface.

## Architecture

### Backend

- **Framework**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: CockroachDB (PostgreSQL-compatible distributed SQL database)
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy with the sqlalchemy-cockroachdb extension
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) via Flask-JWT-Extended
- **Media Processing**: OpenCV and MoviePy for image/video manipulation

### Frontend

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Standard web frontend with minimal JavaScript
- **Template Engine**: Jinja2 (Flask's default)

## Core Components

### 1. User Authentication System

- Signup and login functionality with password security (using JWT)
- Session management for maintaining user state
- Special admin privileges for user management

### 2. Image Upload and Storage

- Multiple image upload support with drag-and-drop functionality
- Binary storage of images in the database via BLOB columns
- User-specific image collections

### 3. Video Generation Engine

- Transition effects: fade-in, fade-out, crossfade, etc.
- Audio selection and incorporation into videos
- Video preview and download functionality

### 4. Admin Interface

- User management and monitoring
- Restricted access to authorized administrators only

## Database Schema

### User Table

-

user_id: Primary key

-

username: Unique user identifier

-

email: User email address

-

password: JWT-encoded password token

### Image Table

-

image_id: Primary key

-

user_id: Foreign key to User table

-

filename: Original filename of uploaded image

-

image_data: BLOB data containing the binary image content

## Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow

1. User submits credentials via the login form
2. Backend validates credentials against database records
3. For passwords, the application creates JWT tokens for storage and verification
4. Upon successful authentication, a user session is created
5. Admin status is determined by username ('admin')

### Image Handling

1. Images are uploaded through a multi-file form
2. Backend reads binary data from uploads
3. Images are stored in the database as BLOBs associated with user_id
4. For rendering, images are retrieved and base64-encoded for HTML display

### Video Generation Process

1. User selects images, transition effects, and audio
2. Backend processes images using OpenCV:
   - Converts binary data to numpy arrays
   - Applies color space conversions (BGR to RGB)
3. MoviePy creates individual clips for each image
4. Transition effects are applied based on user selection
5. Audio is added to the video
6. Final video is rendered and saved to static folder
7. User can preview and download the generated video

## Configuration and Deployment

The application uses environment variables for configuration:

- `DATABASE_URL`: CockroachDB connection string
- `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for JWT and session management
- `FLASK_DEBUG`: Boolean to enable/disable debug mode

The project includes a

render.yaml

configuration file for deployment on Render.com with the following services:

- Web service running Python
- Environment variables for database connection and security

## File Structure Analysis

### Core Application Files

-

app.py: Main Flask application with routes and core logic

-

requirements.txt: Python dependencies

### Frontend Templates

-

landing&loginPage.html: Combined landing and login page

-

signupPage.html: User registration page

-

homePage.html: Main interface after login

-

videoPage.html: Video creation and preview interface

-

adminPage.html: Admin control panel

### Static Files

-

global.css: Global styling

-

homestyle.css: Styling for home page

-

preview.css: Styling for video preview

-

home.js: JavaScript for home page functionality

- Audio files (WAV format) for video soundtracks

## Key Technical Workflows

### User Registration

```
1. User submits signup form →
2. Backend validates uniqueness →
3. Password is tokenized with JWT →
4. User record created in database →
5. Session established →
6. Redirect to login
```

### Image Upload

```
1. User selects images →
2. Form submission with multipart/form-data →
3. Backend processes files →
4. Binary data stored in database →
5. Redirect to video creation page
```

### Video Generation

```
1. User selects transition and audio →
2. Backend queries for user's images →
3. Images converted to numpy arrays →
4. MoviePy creates individual clips →
5. Transitions applied →
6. Audio added →
7. Final video rendered →
8. Preview provided to user
```

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### BLOB Storage for Images

- **Challenge**: Efficient storage and retrieval of binary image data
- **Solution**: Using SQLAlchemy with proper BLOB typing and base64 encoding/decoding

### Video Processing Performance

- **Challenge**: Processing multiple images with transitions efficiently
- **Solution**: Using OpenCV for image processing and MoviePy for video generation with optimized settings

### Security Considerations

- **Challenge**: Secure password storage
- **Solution**: Using JWT for password tokenization (note: typically hashing would be preferred)

## Running the Application

### Local Development

To run the application locally:

1. Set environment variables:

   - `DATABASE_URL` (CockroachDB connection string)
   - `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` (secure random string)
   - `FLASK_DEBUG` (True for development)

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

### Deployment

The application is configured for deployment on Render.com using the included

    render.yaml

file.

## Critical Issues to Address

1. **Authentication Issue**: The application is missing the

    decode_token

function that is called in the login route. This needs to be implemented for the application to run correctly.

```python
# Missing function that needs to be added to app.py
def decode_token(token):
    # This should use the JWT library to decode the token
    # For example:
    from flask_jwt_extended import decode_token as jwt_decode
    return jwt_decode(token)
```

2. **Environment Variables**: The application requires setting environment variables for:

   - `DATABASE_URL`
   - `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`

   Without these, the application will fail to start.

## Run Status

The application as provided **cannot run locally without changes** due to:

1. The missing

    decode_token

function 

2. Requirement for environment variables to be set 3. The need for a CockroachDB instance

After addressing these issues, the application should be capable of running locally. However, the configuration (particularly the

    render.yaml

file) suggests it was primarily designed for deployment on Render.com.

To make it deployable without changes, you would need to:

1. Deploy to Render.com
2. Set up the required environment variables in the Render dashboard
3. Provision a CockroachDB instance and configure the connection string

## Conclusion

This slideshow generator application demonstrates a comprehensive web application with user authentication, database storage, media processing, and frontend interfaces. The architecture follows Flask best practices with a clear separation of concerns. With the identified issues addressed, it provides a functional system for creating custom video slideshows from user-uploaded images.
